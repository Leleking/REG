# REG
this is a Registry web system. 

The system holds information about letters received in a company(i can't add company name for security reasons).
The system was designed to help sort letters in an orderly manner. 
YOU can do multi query here either with the name of the letter, the name and the date, the date or query all letter from the same page

#the lock Screen

the lock screen is a security measure put in place since this isn't using any framework
if the users or guest try to get access to the unauthorized pages, they are bounced to the lock screen

The REG system was put in a MVC like manner for easy understanding
NB:they was no framework used here.
